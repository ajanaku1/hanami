# Specification Quality Checklist: Human Door, Ledger Brief, and Soulbound Tickets

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — product names (0G, World, The Graph) appear only as settled competition constraints, not as implementation choices
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1: all items pass. Six user stories (two P1, three P2, one P3), 21 functional requirements, 10 success criteria, 6 assumptions.
- Traceability: design.md sections → FR-001..FR-021; competition evidence → Assumptions and FR-021.
